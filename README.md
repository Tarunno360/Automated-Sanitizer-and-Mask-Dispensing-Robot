# Automated Sanitizer and Mask Dispensing Robot
This project is aimed at creating the Automated Hygiene and Mask Dispensing Robot that will improve the safety of the population due to absence  of any human contact. The primary goal is the identification of approaching users and the automatic dispensing of hand sanitizers and masks. The Arduino Uno , PIR sensor and ultrasonic sensor are used to sense human movement and measure distance , IR proximity sensors and actuators, i.e., a sanitizer pump and a dc motor are used to dispense masks and sanitizer. There is a 16x 2 LCD screen, which takes the user through the procedure. The operations are all automated, hygienic as well aimed at avoiding repeated triggering.
The prototype can show a valid low-cost, cost-effective solution applicable in crowded social places. Sustainably, it would promote improved physical hygiene practices, minimize physical contact with communal surfaces and provide practical way to individual health in resource-constrained areas, such as Bangladesh.
